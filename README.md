# DistributedComputing
Distributed Computing via HTML communication
Problem To be Solve: 
Your research requires many simulations of similar
problems, differing through a series of parameters. 
These parameters are typically given as fixed set of parameters or as
random variables with mean value and standard variation. 
Since multiple computers are available, you can create
a client-server tool that helps you to parallelize and thus speed up your
computations.

This is what this project for.
